This is my Berlin to Durban project happenning on my flight between Berlin and Durban - including all 4 connection flights :)

## List of ideas

1. Write a dependancy graph rendered that outputs an interactive HTML display
2. Convert 'flight watch' to backbone.js
3. Taggable file system

**UPDATE**: Demo here: http://thebacklog.net/2012/10/13/visualizing-lernantas-inter-dependancies/
